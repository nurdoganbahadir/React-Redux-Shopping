# Hi I'm NurdoÄŸan BahadÄ±r ðŸ‘‹. Welcome to my Bahadir Shopping Project with React.

This project was developed with React. Redux and Mateial UI were also used in the application. In the project, the data received from the API is shown to the user on the home page. The user can add products to the cart and increase or decrease the number of products in the cart. The button to empty the entire cart and the total price are presented to the user.
